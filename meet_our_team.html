            <p class="article-text1">&emsp;My name is Chris Meyer and I am the lead pastor at Calvary Church in Angleton, Texas. I grew up in a Christian home and I thought I was going to be an engineer, but I felt God calling me to the ministry while I was on a mission trip in the Dominican Republic.   â€‹I have served in various leadership roles in ministry as an associate pastor and missionary to the Dominican Republic.  I am a High School Spanish teacher and I coach various sports as well.<br>
            &emsp;My wife Abigail and I have been married for over fifteen years, and we have four amazing children: Gabby, Mia, Adam, and Mark. Together we look forward to serving God, sharing the gospel, and helping our community. </p>
